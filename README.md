# vPdi #

vPdi is a PHP library that provides vCard & iCalendar data formats support. iCalendar support is partial for the moment, but still useful. 
A modified version of this library is notably used by the OBM collaborative suite. 

The library is well-tested using PHPUnit. Have a look at the tests to see usage examples.
